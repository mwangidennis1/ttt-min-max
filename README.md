### Tic Tac Toe with Min Max algortihm

This code implements the Minimax algorithm using a heuristic function to assign values to game states.
While the implementation is simple, it is used to illustrate how the Minimax algorithm works.
This program is written based on ideas represented [here](https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/CMSC351/notes/minimax.pdf).

To try the program, compile it with:

```
 cc  main.c -o main -Wall -Wextra

```
Then run with
```
 ./main

```

### Future Work

Some things I will try in the future:
* Improve the Minimax algorithm by using Alpha-Beta Pruning.
* Implement Minimax in a game with a larger state space.
